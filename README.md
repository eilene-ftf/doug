# Doug
A repository for the Doug polynomial time programming language defined over a vector-symbolic architecture.

Doug was prepared for a paper to appear in [ICCM 2025](https://mathpsych.org/conference/19/). This repo does not currently host running code; the implementation (requested by reviewers) is under development.
